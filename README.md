# Self-Driving Car

This project simulates a fully functional Self-Driving Car with Convolutional Neural 
Networks and Computer Vision. There are many processes that I have gone through to make
this project go through succesfully. Here are the specific tasks that I have done:

* Trained a Deep Learning Model that can identify between 43 different Traffic Signs
* Applied Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to build automotive-related 
algorithms 
* Built and trained Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras
* Used essential Computer Vision techniques to identify lane lines on a road

## Installation

Just simply clone the repository by copying the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oasysokubo/Self-Driving-Car.git
```

## Usage

```bash
python <file_name>
```
